ABOUT THE SCRIPT

Update bundle is a script that is to be used to refresh the tbxsosd
bundle from the last repository sources on Ketchup.

It supports the creation a stable and unstable bundle.

STABLE AND UNSTABLE BUNDLES

The stable bundle is the bundle to be used for client activation on
production sites. Once it is established, it should not be changed
until a next major release.

The unstable bundle might be regenerated at will during development of
a new version. It can be used to activate test servers or new servers
to be setup as production server.

UPDATING A BUNDLE

The update_bundle scripts has 2 subcommands:

    update_bundle new

which refreshes the unstable bundle, and:

    update_bundle commit

which changes the stable bundle with the content of the currently
unstable bundle. This won't ask for confirmation so please consider
what you are doing before using 'commit'.

CHOOSING THE BUNDLE

The stable bundle is the one that is choosen by default by cliadm
during the standard activation process. You don't have to do anything
to select the stable bundle.

To select the unstable bundle for a client, use the 'genkap' command
with the 'unstable' parameter. If you are using the wizard, simply
walk through each wizard steps like you normally would. Once the
wizard finished, use the 'genkap' command with the unstable parameter
to produce another KAP for the client you just created that is
including the unstable KAP.
